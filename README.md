# Linear_regression_Ml

project where I applied linear regression to predict weight based on height using Python. This fundamental technique in machine learning allowed me to build a predictive model with clear, actionable insights


ðŸ“Š Data:
Heights (in cm)
Weights (in kg)


ðŸ“ˆ Process:
Data Preparation: Loaded and split the dataset.
Model Training: Trained the model using height as the feature.
Evaluation: Measured performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Prediction: Predicted weight for new height values.
